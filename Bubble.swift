//Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, 
//compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
//The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. 
//The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
